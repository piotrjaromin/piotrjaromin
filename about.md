I'm software developer with experience in full stack technologies. I have gone through java to golang and nodejs(with scala, groovy, and some other languages along the way).

I have used to work with java ee, spring, postgres, jenkins, mocha, expressjs, echo(golang), goconvey, influxdb, mongo, cloudfoundry, docker.

Purpose of this blog is to have concise way of reminding me of different things.
